## Major Project Proposal

## Description;
I would like to create a simulation/game where you get to control an Ant Colony. The game will have a starter Queen that you have control over. You will have to lay the first batch of eggs and use your workers to gather resources you will have to manage the resources/territory of the colony to make it thrive. The goal of the game will be to have (undecided) number of workers, in order to gain more workers you will have to have a sustainable food to feed your larva and workers combined.


## Need to have list
- A gameplay GUI and a Menu screen
- A class system for the workers to be able to interact with eachother and the enviroment around them
- Other insect classes that act as either the prey or predator to the colony
- A gridbased map/backround enviroment containing the resources needed to sustain a colony and for the worker class to interact with
- The ability to change the behavior of your colony with player inputs and control it as a whole

## Nice to have list 
- Animations for the Ants/Queens/Larva
- The ability to save your progress and play another time
- Map being bigger than the window screen with a scrolling mechanic if the mouse is on the edge of the canvas to see it
- Individual AI ant colonies(could be enemies or neutral) that make descisions based on where they are located
- 2 minigames(probably going to be grid based)
- Have a new procedurally generated map each time a new game is played
- The ability to have a online multiplayer gamemode
