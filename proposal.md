#Major Project Proposal

##Description;
I would like to create a simulation/game where you get to control an Ant Colony. The game will have a starter Queen that you have control over. You will have to lay the first batch of eggs and use your workers to gather resources you will have to manage the resources/territory of the colony to make it thrive. The goal of the game will be to have ____ number of workers, in order to gain more workers you will have to have a sustainable food to feed your larva and workers combined.


## Need to have list
- A gameplay GUI and a Menu screen
- Animations for the Ants/Queens/Larva
- A class system for the workers to be able to interact with eachother and the enviroment around them
- A gridbased map/backround enviroment containing the resources needed to sustain a colony and for the worker class to interact with

## Nice to have list 
- The ability to save your progress and play another time
- Map being bigger than the window screen with a scrolling mechanic if the mouse is on the edge to see it
- Individual AI ant colonies that make descisions based on where they are located
